## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### 1. **Client Email Notifications**
**Status:** Not automatic

**Why:** Service accounts cannot send calendar invitations without Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority (complex Google Workspace setup).

**Current Workaround:**
- Calendar event is created on YOUR calendar with all client details
- Client email is in the event description
- You need to manually email the client with the Google Meet link

**Options to Fix:**
1. **Manual (easiest):** Copy Meet link from calendar and email client
2. **Use a third-party email service:** Integrate SendGrid, Resend, or Mailgun
3. **Set up Domain-Wide Delegation:** (complex, requires Google Workspace admin)

### 2. **Host Email Notifications**
**Status:** Partially implemented

**Current State:**
- Code is in place to send you booking notifications via Gmail API
- May not work without Gmail API being properly enabled

**To Enable:**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Enable Gmail API
3. Update service account scopes

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### **Option 1: Keep It Simple (Recommended)**
Accept that clients won't get automatic emails and:
1. Check your calendar after each booking
2. Manually email clients with the Google Meet link
3. This gives you more control and personal touch

### **Option 2: Add Email Service**
Integrate a proper email service:
- **Resend** (100 free emails/day) - easiest
- **SendGrid** (100 free emails/day)
- **Mailgun** (5,000 free emails/month)

This would send beautiful automated emails to clients with:
- Booking confirmation
- Google Meet link
- Appointment details

## 💰 Pricing

Current setting: `CONSULTATION_PRICE=100` ($1.00)

**To change price:**
- Update in Vercel environment variables
- Price in cents (e.g., 4900 = $49.00)
- Minimum Stripe allows: $0.50 (50 cents)

## 🧪 Testing

**Test Card:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`

## 🎉 Summary

**The core booking system is fully functional!**

What works:
- ✅ Beautiful UI with cloud background
- ✅ Custom availability schedule
- ✅ Stripe payment processing
- ✅ Automatic calendar event creation
- ✅ Google Meet link generation
- ✅ Time slot blocking
