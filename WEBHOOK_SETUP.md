# üîó Stripe Webhook Setup Guide

## Why You Need This

The webhook is what makes everything work automatically:
- ‚úÖ Creates Google Calendar events after payment
- ‚úÖ Sends email confirmations to client
- ‚úÖ Sends booking notification to you
- ‚úÖ Blocks the time slot from being booked again

Without the webhook, **none of this happens** - payments go through but nothing else triggers.

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Get Your Webhook URL

Your webhook endpoint is:
```

   - Check the box next to it
   - Click "Add events"
6. Click **"Add endpoint"**

### 3. Copy the Signing Secret

After creating the webhook, you'll see a page with:
- Webhook endpoint details

Click **"Reveal"** and copy the entire secret.

### 4. Add to Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project (`divine-consultation`)

### 5. Redeploy

After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢** menu on the latest deployment

## ‚úÖ Testing the Webhook

### Test a Booking:

1. Go to your live site
2. Book a consultation
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

### What Should Happen:

1. ‚úÖ Redirect to confirmation page
2. ‚úÖ Google Calendar event created
3. ‚úÖ Client receives calendar invitation email
4. ‚úÖ You receive booking notification email
5. ‚úÖ Time slot disappears from available slots

### If Something Fails:

Check webhook logs in Stripe:

2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. View the **"Attempts"** tab
4. Look for any failed requests and error messages

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Webhook signature verification failed"
- Make sure you added the correct `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to Vercel
- Make sure you redeployed after adding it

### "No events showing up"
- Check that you selected `checkout.session.completed` event
- Make sure the webhook URL is exactly correct (no trailing slash)

### "Calendar event not created"
- Check Vercel logs for errors
- Verify Google Calendar API credentials are correct
- Make sure Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

## üìß Gmail API Setup (If Emails Not Working)

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Library"**
4. Search for **"Gmail API"**
5. Click **"Enable"**
6. Go back and verify it's enabled in **"Enabled APIs & services"**

## üéØ Current Status

- ‚úÖ Payment redirect working
- ‚è≥ Webhook setup (you're doing this now)
- ‚è≥ Calendar events (will work after webhook)
- ‚è≥ Email notifications (will work after webhook + Gmail API)

Once you complete the webhook setup, **test again** and everything should work! üöÄ
