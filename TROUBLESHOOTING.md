# üîß Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues After Deployment

### 1. "Failed to load available times" or API 500 Error

**Cause:** Environment variables not set correctly in Vercel

**Fix:**
1. Go to Vercel project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Make sure ALL these are set:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` (with quotes and `\n` characters!)
   - `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CONSULTATION_PRICE`
   - `CONSULTATION_DURATION_MINUTES`
   - `CONSULTATION_TIMEZONE`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
3. **Redeploy** after adding/updating variables

### 2. React Hydration Error (#423)

**Error:** `Uncaught Error: Minified React error #423`

**Cause:** Minor React hydration mismatch (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)

**Fix:** Can be ignored if booking works. If it bothers you:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Try incognito/private mode

---

### 3. Google Calendar Events Not Creating

**Cause:** Webhook not set up or incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Check Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint
2. Look at "Recent deliveries" tab
3. See if webhook is being called
4. Check response - should be 200 OK
5. If 500 error, check Vercel logs

**Check Vercel Logs:**
1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Look for webhook errors
4. Usually shows Google Calendar API errors

---

### 4. "GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY" Issues

**Symptoms:**
- API returns "Calendar not configured"
- Webhook fails to create event

**Fix:**
Make sure `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` is formatted correctly:
```bash
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADAN...REST_OF_KEY...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

**Important:**
- Keep the quotes around it
- Include all `\n` characters
- Don't add extra spaces or line breaks
- Copy EXACTLY from the JSON file

---

### 5. No Email Confirmations

**Cause:** Calendar event not created (see #3)

**Once calendar event IS created:**
- Emails are automatic from Google Calendar
- Check spam folder
- Wait 1-2 minutes (can be delayed)

---

### 6. Payments Work But No Booking

**Cause:** Webhook secret incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Go to Stripe ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint
2. Click "Reveal" signing secret
3. Copy the `whsec_...` value
4. Update in Vercel: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
5. Redeploy

---

### 7. Wrong Timezone

**Symptoms:** Events show at wrong time

**Fix:**
Update in Vercel:
```bash
CONSULTATION_TIMEZONE=America/New_York  # Or your timezone
```

Find your timezone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

---

### 8. No Available Time Slots

**Cause:** Your Google Calendar is fully booked

**Fix:**
1. Check your Google Calendar
2. Make sure you have free slots during 9 AM - 5 PM
3. Or update working hours in `app/api/availability/route.ts`

---

### 9. Webhook Not Receiving Events

**Symptoms:** Payment succeeds but no calendar event

**Check:**
1. Webhook URL is correct: `https://YOUR-SITE.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
2. Event selected: `checkout.session.completed`
3. Webhook is in same mode as keys (test/live)

**Test Webhook:**
1. Go to Stripe ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint
2. Click "Send test webhook"
3. Select `checkout.session.completed`
4. Check Vercel logs for errors

---

### 10. Build/Deploy Fails

**Error:** "Failed to collect page data"

**Cause:** Environment variables not set during build

**Fix:**
1. Add all environment variables BEFORE deploying
2. If already deployed, add missing variables
3. Trigger a new deployment (Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy)
